# YUDL Taxonomy Reconciliation

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) [reconciliation](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/reconciling) API for Drupal taxonomy terms via Search API Solr.

## Requirements

- search_api
  Assumes that there is an existing index named `taxonomy_reconciliation`. See `config/optional/search_api.index.taxonomy_reconciliation.yml`.

## Installation

- `drush en yudl_taxonomy_reconcile`

## Using the YUDL Reconciliation Service with OpenRefine

This guide walks you through reconciling data in [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) against YUDL authorities, matching strings in your project to controlled vocabulary terms and retrieving their Term IDs (TIDs).

---

### Prerequisites

- OpenRefine installed and running
- A project open in OpenRefine with a column you want to reconcile

---

### Step 1: Open the Reconciliation Dialog

1. Click the **arrow** at the top of the column you want to reconcile
2. Choose **Reconcile → Start Reconciling...**

---

### Step 2: Add the YUDL Reconciliation Service

1. Click **Add Standard Service** in the bottom left corner of the dialog
2. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://digital.library.yorku.ca/api/reconcile
   ```
3. Click **Add Service**

The service will appear in the list as **YUDL Taxonomy Authorities**.

---

### Step 3: Choose a Reconciliation Type

You will see a list of available vocabulary types:

* [Person](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/person)
* [Subject](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/subject)
* [Corporate Body](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/corporate-body)
* [City](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/city)
* [City Section](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/city-section)
* [Country](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/country)
* [County](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/county)
* [Family](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/family)
* [Genre](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/genre)
* [Geographic Subject](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/geographic-subject)
* [Language](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/language)
* [Physical Form](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/physical-form)
* [Province](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/province)
* [Region](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/region)
* [Resource Type](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/resource-type)
* [Rights](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/rights)
* [Tags (keywords)](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/keywords)
* [Temporal Subjects](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/search/authorities/temporal-subject)

Select the taxonomy that matches the content of your column. For example, if your column contains subject headings, select **Subject**.

### Step 4: Start Reconciling

Click **Start Reconciling** in the bottom right corner. OpenRefine will query the YUDL Reconciliation Service for each cell in your column. This may take a moment depending on the size of your project.

---

### Step 5: Review and Accept Matches

Once reconciliation is complete, each cell will display the closest matches found. For each cell:

- Click on a candidate to open the corresponding YUDL authority page in your browser and verify it is the correct match
- Click the **single check** (✓) beside a match to accept it for that cell only
- Click the **double check** (✓✓) beside a match to accept it for all cells containing the same value

Repeat until you have accepted or dismissed matches for all cells.

---

### Step 6: Save the Reconciled Data

!!! important 
    Although reconciled matches appear in your OpenRefine project, OpenRefine is still storing the original values internally. You must explicitly extract the reconciled data into a new column to ensure it is included when you export your project.

### To add a new column containing the TID:

1. Click the **arrow** at the top of the reconciled column
2. Choose **Edit Columns → Add column based on this column...**
3. Give the new column a name — a good convention is the original column name plus `_tid`, for example `field_subject_tid`
4. In the **GREL expression** box, enter:
   ```
   cell.recon.match.id
   ```
5. Click **OK**

#### To add a new column containing the matched label:

1. Repeat the steps above
2. Name the column with a `_label` suffix, for example `field_subject_label`
3. In the **GREL expression** box, enter:
   ```
   cell.recon.match.name
   ```
4. Click **OK**

#### Other useful GREL expressions

| What you want | GREL expression |
|---|---|
| TID only | `cell.recon.match.id` |
| Matched label | `cell.recon.match.name` |
| Match score (0–100) | `cell.recon.best.score` |
| Whether it was auto-matched | `cell.recon.matched` |

---

### Notes

- If a cell shows **no match**, the reconciliation service found nothing close enough to suggest. You may want to check the spelling or try reconciling against a different vocabulary type.
- If multiple candidates appear and none are correct, click the **×** to dismiss and leave the cell unmatched.
- You can re-reconcile a column at any time by repeating this process.
